Task Manager Project --


The Task Manager project is a simple web application built using HTML and CSS that allows users to manage their tasks. With this application, users can add, edit, and search for their saved tasks. All tasks are stored locally using the browser's local storage feature, ensuring that your tasks are saved even after you close the browser.

Features :


Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list. Simply enter the task details and click the "Add" button.

Edit Tasks: Made a mistake or need to update a task? You can edit any task that you've added previously.

Search Tasks: If your task list grows, you can quickly search for specific tasks using the search feature. It helps you find what you're looking for without scrolling through the entire list.
